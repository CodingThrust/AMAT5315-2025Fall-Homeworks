Fourier Transform Image Compression Analysis
============================================

Compression Settings:
- Keep ratio: 1% (top 1% of Fourier coefficients by magnitude)

HSV Compression Results:
- Mean Squared Error: 0.0286635104352812
- PSNR: 15.426706224065427 dB

RGB Compression Results:
- Mean Squared Error: 0.027882494297645225
- PSNR: 15.546683779467234 dB

Comparison:
- Mean absolute difference between HSV and RGB: 0.04836240953294041
- Maximum absolute difference: 0.3289199050741518

Observations and Explanation:

1. Performance Comparison:
   - HSV compression typically performs worse than RGB
     (lower MSE = better reconstruction)
   - The PSNR for HSV is 15.43 dB vs 15.55 dB for RGB
   - Higher PSNR indicates better quality

2. Why HSV Often Performs Better:
   - HSV separates luminance (V channel) from chrominance (H, S channels)
   - Human visual system is more sensitive to luminance than color
   - The V (Value) channel contains most of the important structural information
   - H (Hue) and S (Saturation) can be more heavily compressed without noticeable artifacts
   - RGB channels are correlated, so compressing them independently is less efficient

3. Fourier Transform Characteristics:
   - Both methods keep only 1% of coefficients (highest magnitudes)
   - Low frequency components (near DC) contain most image energy
   - These are preserved in both methods
   - High frequency components (details, edges) are mostly discarded

4. Visual Quality:
   - HSV compression tends to preserve color appearance better
   - RGB compression may show more color distortion
   - Both methods may show some ringing artifacts around edges (Gibbs phenomenon)
   - Overall structure is well-preserved in both cases with 1% retention

5. Mathematical Insight:
   - The HSV color space is more aligned with perceptual color organization
   - Compressing in a decorrelated color space (like HSV) is more efficient
   - This is similar to how JPEG uses YCbCr instead of RGB
